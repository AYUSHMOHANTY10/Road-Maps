<h1 id="packages" tabindex="-1" class="text-5xl font-bold mb-5 mt-2">Packages</h1><p class="mb-4">A package is a namespace that mainly contains classes and interfaces. For instance, the standard class <code>ArrayList</code> is in the package <code>java.util</code>. For this class, <code>java.util.ArrayList</code> is called its fully qualified name because this syntax has no ambiguity. Classes in different packages can have the same name. For example, you have the two classes <code>java.util.Date</code> and <code>java.sql.Date</code>, which are different. If no package is declared in a class, its package is the default package.</p>
