In computer science, an input is information put into the program by the user and state refers to the condition of an application according to its stored inputs – saved as variables or constants. State can also be described as the collection of preserved information that forms a complete session.</p><div class="mb-4 mt-7"><h1 class="text-sm font-semibold uppercase mb-3 block text-gray-700 border-b border-b-gray-100">Free Content</h1><p class="mb-0.5 text-md"><a href="https://www.techtarget.com/searchapparchitecture/definition/state-management" class="text-blue-900 hover:text-blue-600"><span class="bg-yellow-200 text-yellow-900 text-xs font-semibold mr-1.5 px-1.5 py-0.5 rounded uppercase relative -top-0.5">Read</span> What is State Management?</a></p></div>
