<h1 id="source-of-randomness-attacks" tabindex="-1" class="text-5xl font-bold mb-5 mt-2">Source of Randomness Attacks</h1><p class="mb-4">The security of cryptographic systems depends on some secret data that is known to authorized persons but unknown and unpredictable to others. To achieve this unpredictability, some randomization is typically employed. Modern cryptographic protocols often require frequent generation of random quantities. Cryptographic attacks that subvert or exploit weaknesses in this process are known as randomness attacks.</p><div class="mb-4 mt-7"><h1 class="text-sm font-semibold uppercase mb-3 block text-gray-700 border-b border-b-gray-100">Free Content</h1><p class="mb-0.5 text-md"><a href="https://blog.finxter.com/randomness-or-replicatedlogic-attack-on-smart-contracts/" class="text-blue-900 hover:text-blue-600"><span class="bg-yellow-200 text-yellow-900 text-xs font-semibold mr-1.5 px-1.5 py-0.5 rounded uppercase relative -top-0.5">Read</span> Smart Contract Randomness or ReplicatedLogic Attack</a></p></div>
