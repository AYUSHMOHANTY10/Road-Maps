<h1 id="expressions-and-operators" tabindex="-1" class="text-5xl font-bold mb-5 mt-2">Expressions and Operators</h1><p class="mb-4">At a high level, an expression is a valid unit of code that resolves to a value. There are two types of expressions: those that have side effects (such as assigning values) and those that purely evaluate. The expression <code>x = 7</code> is an example of the first type. This expression uses the <code>=</code> operator to assign the value seven to the variable x. The expression itself evaluates to 7. The expression <code>3 + 4</code> is an example of the second type. This expression uses the <code>+</code> operator to add <code>3</code> and <code>4</code> together and produces a value, <code>7</code>. However, if it’s not eventually part of a bigger construct (for example, a variable declaration like const <code>z = 3 + 4</code>), its result will be immediately discarded <code>—</code> this is usually a programmer mistake because the evaluation doesn’t produce any effects. As the examples above also illustrate, all complex expressions are joined by operators, such as <code>=</code> and <code>+</code>.</p><div class="mb-4 mt-7"><h1 class="text-sm font-semibold uppercase mb-3 block text-gray-700 border-b border-b-gray-100">Free Content</h1><p class="mb-0.5 text-md"><a href="https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Expressions_and_Operators" class="text-blue-900 hover:text-blue-600"><span class="bg-yellow-200 text-yellow-900 text-xs font-semibold mr-1.5 px-1.5 py-0.5 rounded uppercase relative -top-0.5">Read</span> Expressions and operators</a></p></div>
