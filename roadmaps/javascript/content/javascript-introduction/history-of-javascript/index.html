<h1 id="history-of-javascript" tabindex="-1" class="text-5xl font-bold mb-5 mt-2">History of JavaScript</h1><p class="mb-4">JavaScript was initially created by Brendan Eich of NetScape and was first announced in a press release by Netscape in 1995. It has a bizarre history of naming; initally it was named Mocha by the creator, which was later renamed to LiveScript. In 1996, about a year later after the release, NetScape decided to rename it to be JavaScript with hopes of capitalizing on the Java community (although JavaScript did not have any relationship with Java) and released Netscape 2.0 with the official support of JavaScript.</p><div class="mb-4 mt-7"><h1 class="text-sm font-semibold uppercase mb-3 block text-gray-700 border-b border-b-gray-100">Free Content</h1><p class="mb-0.5 text-md"><a href="https://roadmap.sh/guides/history-of-javascript" class="text-blue-900 hover:text-blue-600"><span class="bg-yellow-200 text-yellow-900 text-xs font-semibold mr-1.5 px-1.5 py-0.5 rounded uppercase relative -top-0.5">Read</span> Brief History of JavaScript</a></p><p class="mb-0.5 text-md"><a href="https://dev.to/iarchitsharma/the-history-of-javascript-5e98" class="text-blue-900 hover:text-blue-600"><span class="bg-yellow-200 text-yellow-900 text-xs font-semibold mr-1.5 px-1.5 py-0.5 rounded uppercase relative -top-0.5">Read</span> The History of JavaScript</a></p></div>
