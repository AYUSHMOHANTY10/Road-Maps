Most internet systems use SMTP as a method to transfer mail from one user to another. SMTP is a push protocol and is used to send the mail whereas POP (post office protocol) or IMAP (internet message access protocol) are used to retrieve those emails at the receiverâ€™s side.</p><p class="mb-4">SMTP is an application layer protocol. The client who wants to send the mail opens a TCP connection to the SMTP server and then sends the mail across the connection. The SMTP server is an always-on listening mode. As soon as it listens for a TCP connection from any client, the SMTP process initiates a connection through port 25. After successfully establishing a TCP connection the client process sends the mail instantly.</p><div class="mb-4 mt-7"><h1 class="text-sm font-semibold uppercase mb-3 block text-gray-700 border-b border-b-gray-100">Free Content</h1><p class="mb-0.5 text-md"><a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/simple-mail-transfer-protocol-smtp/" class="text-blue-900 hover:text-blue-600"><span class="bg-yellow-200 text-yellow-900 text-xs font-semibold mr-1.5 px-1.5 py-0.5 rounded uppercase relative -top-0.5">Read</span> What is Simple Mail Transfer Protocol (SMTP)?</a></p></div>
