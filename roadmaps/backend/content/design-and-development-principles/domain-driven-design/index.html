For example, if a software processes loan applications, it might have classes like LoanApplication and Customer, and methods such as AcceptOffer and Withdraw.</p><p class="mb-4">DDD connects the implementation to an evolving model and it is predicated on the following goals:</p><ul><li>Placing the project’s primary focus on the core domain and domain logic;</li><li>Basing complex designs on a model of the domain;</li><li>Initiating a creative collaboration between technical and domain experts to iteratively refine a conceptual model that addresses particular domain problems.</li></ul><div class="mb-4 mt-7"><h1 class="text-sm font-semibold uppercase mb-3 block text-gray-700 border-b border-b-gray-100">Free Content</h1><p class="mb-0.5 text-md"><a href="https://matfrs2.github.io/RS2/predavanja/literatura/Avram%20A,%20Marinescu%20F.%20-%20Domain%20Driven%20Design%20Quickly.pdf" class="text-blue-900 hover:text-blue-600"><span class="bg-yellow-200 text-yellow-900 text-xs font-semibold mr-1.5 px-1.5 py-0.5 rounded uppercase relative -top-0.5">Read</span> Domain Driven Design Quickly</a></p></div>
