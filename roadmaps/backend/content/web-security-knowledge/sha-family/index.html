<h1 id="sha-family" tabindex="-1" class="text-5xl font-bold mb-5 mt-2">SHA family</h1><p class="mb-4">SHA (Secure Hash Algorithms) is a family of cryptographic hash functions created by the NIST (National Institute of Standards and Technology). The family includes:</p><ul><li>SHA-0: Published in 1993, this is the first algorithm in the family. Shortly after its release, it was discontinued for an undisclosed significant flaw.</li><li>SHA-1: Created to replace SHA-0 and which resembles MD5, this algorithm has been considered insecure since 2010.</li><li>SHA-2: This isn’t an algorithm, but a set of them, with SHA-256 and SHA-512 being the most popular. SHA-2 is still secure and widely used.</li><li>SHA-3: Born in a competition, this is the newest member of the family. SHA-3 is very secure and doesn’t carry the same design flaws as its brethren.</li></ul><div class="mb-4 mt-7"><h1 class="text-sm font-semibold uppercase mb-3 block text-gray-700 border-b border-b-gray-100">Free Content</h1><p class="mb-0.5 text-md"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-1" class="text-blue-900 hover:text-blue-600"><span class="bg-yellow-200 text-yellow-900 text-xs font-semibold mr-1.5 px-1.5 py-0.5 rounded uppercase relative -top-0.5">Read</span> Wikipedia - SHA-1</a></p><p class="mb-0.5 text-md"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-2" class="text-blue-900 hover:text-blue-600"><span class="bg-yellow-200 text-yellow-900 text-xs font-semibold mr-1.5 px-1.5 py-0.5 rounded uppercase relative -top-0.5">Read</span> Wikipedia - SHA-2</a></p><p class="mb-0.5 text-md"><a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/SHA-3" class="text-blue-900 hover:text-blue-600"><span class="bg-yellow-200 text-yellow-900 text-xs font-semibold mr-1.5 px-1.5 py-0.5 rounded uppercase relative -top-0.5">Read</span> Wikipedia - SHA-3</a></p></div>
