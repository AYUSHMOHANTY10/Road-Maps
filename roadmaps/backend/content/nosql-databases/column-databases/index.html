<h1 id="column-databases" tabindex="-1" class="text-5xl font-bold mb-5 mt-2">Column Databases</h1><p class="mb-4">A <strong><u>columnar database</u></strong> is a database management system (DBMS) that stores data in columns as opposed to rows. The main advantage of columnar databases over row-oriented ones is their <strong><u>faster performance</u></strong>; this is due in large part to them accessing less memory to output data. This column structure can store more data in a smaller amount of memory. And because the initial data retrieval is done on a column-by-column basis, only the columns that need to be used are retrieved. This grants columnar databases like <strong>Cassandra DB</strong> their ability to scale efficiently and handle large amounts of data.</p>
