Context provides a way to share values like these between components without having to explicitly pass a prop through every level of the tree.</p><div class="mb-4 mt-7"><h1 class="text-sm font-semibold uppercase mb-3 block text-gray-700 border-b border-b-gray-100">Free Content</h1><p class="mb-0.5 text-md"><a href="https://reactjs.org/docs/context.html" class="text-blue-900 hover:text-blue-600"><span class="bg-yellow-200 text-yellow-900 text-xs font-semibold mr-1.5 px-1.5 py-0.5 rounded uppercase relative -top-0.5">Read</span> Official React Context Docs</a></p></div>
