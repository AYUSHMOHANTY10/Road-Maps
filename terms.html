You promise to abide by all copyright notices, trademark rules, information, and restrictions contained in any Content you access through the Services, and you won’t use, copy, reproduce, modify, translate, publish, broadcast, transmit, distribute, perform, upload, display, license, sell or otherwise exploit for any purpose any Content not owned by you, (i) without the prior consent of the owner of that Content or (ii) in a way that violates someone else’s (including roadmap.sh’s) rights.</p><p>You understand that roadmap.sh owns the Services. You won’t modify, publish, transmit, participate in the transfer or sale of, reproduce (except as expressly provided in this Section), create derivative works based on, or otherwise exploit any of the Services.</p><p>The Services may allow you to copy or download certain Content; please remember that just because this functionality exists, doesn’t mean that all the restrictions above don’t apply – they do!</p><h2 id=do-i-have-to-grant-any-licenses-to-roadmapsh-or-to-other-users>Do I have to grant any licenses to roadmap.sh or to other users?</h2><p>Anything you post, upload, share, store, or otherwise provide through the Services is your “User Submission.” Some User Submissions are viewable by other users. In order to display your User Submissions on the Services, and to allow other users to enjoy them (where applicable), you grant us certain rights in those User Submissions. Please note that all of the following licenses are subject to our Privacy Policy to the extent they relate to User Submissions that are also your personally-identifiable information.</p><p>For all User Submissions, you hereby grant roadmap.sh a license to translate, modify (for technical purposes, for example making sure your content is viewable on an iPhone as well as a computer) and reproduce and otherwise act with respect to such User Submissions, in each case to enable us to operate the Services, as described in more detail below. This is a license only – your ownership in User Submissions is not affected.</p><p>If you store a User Submission in your own personal roadmap.sh account, in a manner that is not viewable by any other user except you (a “Personal User Submission”), you grant roadmap.sh the license above, as well as a license to display, perform, and distribute your Personal User Submission for the sole purpose of making that Personal User Submission accessible to you and providing the Services necessary to do so.</p><p>If you share a User Submission only in a manner that only certain specified users can view (for example, a private message to one or more other users) (a “Limited Audience User Submission”), then you grant roadmap.sh the licenses above, as well as a license to display, perform, and distribute your Limited Audience User Submission for the sole purpose of making that Limited Audience User Submission accessible to such other specified users, and providing the Services necessary to do so. Also, you grant such other specified users a license to access that Limited Audience User Submission, and to use and exercise all rights in it, as permitted by the functionality of the Services.</p><p>If you share a User Submission publicly on the Services and/or in a manner that more than just you or certain specified users can view, or if you provide us (in a direct email or otherwise) with any feedback, suggestions, improvements, enhancements, and/or feature requests relating to the Services] (each of the foregoing, a “Public User Submission”), then you grant roadmap.sh the licenses above, as well as a license to display, perform, and distribute your Public User Submission for the purpose of making that Public User Submission accessible to all roadmap.sh users and providing the Services necessary to do so, as well as all other rights necessary to use and exercise all rights in that Public User Submission in connection with the Services and/or otherwise in connection with roadmap.sh’s business for any purpose, provided that roadmap.sh will try to notify you if it uses your Public User Submission for any reason other than displaying it on the Services. Also, you grant all other users of the Services a license to access that Public User Submission, and to use and exercise all rights in it, as permitted by the functionality of the Services.</p><p>You agree that the licenses you grant are royalty-free, perpetual, sublicenseable, irrevocable, and worldwide, provided that when you delete your roadmap.sh account, we will stop displaying your User Submissions (other than Public User Submissions, which may remain fully available)] to other users (if applicable), but you understand and agree that it may not be possible to completely delete that content from roadmap.sh’s records, and that your User Submissions may remain viewable elsewhere to the extent that they were copied or stored by other users.</p><p>Finally, you understand and agree that roadmap.sh, in performing the required technical steps to provide the Services to our users (including you), may need to make changes to your User Submissions to conform and adapt those User Submissions to the technical requirements of connection networks, devices, services, or media, and the foregoing licenses include the rights to do so.</p><h2 id=what-if-i-see-something-on-the-services-that-infringes-my-copyright>What if I see something on the Services that infringes my copyright?</h2><p>You may have heard of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (the “DMCA”), as it relates to online service providers, like roadmap.sh, being asked to remove material that allegedly violates someone’s copyright. We respect others’ intellectual property rights, and we reserve the right to delete or disable Content alleged to be infringing, and to terminate the accounts of repeat alleged infringers.</p><h2 id=who-is-responsible-for-what-i-see-and-do-on-the-services>Who is responsible for what I see and do on the Services?</h2><p>Any information or content publicly posted or privately transmitted through the Services is the sole responsibility of the person from whom such content originated, and you access all such information and content at your own risk, and we aren’t liable for any errors or omissions in that information or content or for any damages or loss you might suffer in connection with it. We cannot control and have no duty to take any action regarding how you may interpret and use the Content or what actions you may take as a result of having been exposed to the Content, and you hereby release us from all liability for you having acquired or not acquired Content through the Services. We can’t guarantee the identity of any users with whom you interact in using the Services and are not responsible for which users gain access to the Services.</p><p>You are responsible for all Content you contribute, in any manner, to the Services, and you represent and warrant you have all rights necessary to do so, in the manner in which you contribute it. You will keep all your registration information accurate and current. You are responsible for all your activity in connection with the Services.</p><p>The Services may contain links or connections to third party websites or services that are not owned or controlled by roadmap.sh. When you access third party websites or use third party services, you accept that there are risks in doing so, and that roadmap.sh is not responsible for such risks. We encourage you to be aware when you leave the Services and to read the terms and conditions and privacy policy of each third party website or service that you visit or utilize.</p><p>roadmap.sh has no control over, and assumes no responsibility for, the content, accuracy, privacy policies, or practices of or opinions expressed in any third party websites or by any third party that you interact with through the Services. In addition, roadmap.sh will not and cannot monitor, verify, censor or edit the content of any third party site or service. By using the Services, you release and hold us harmless from any and all liability arising from your use of any third party website or service.</p><p>Your interactions with organizations and/or individuals found on or through the Services, including payment and delivery of goods or services, and any other terms, conditions, warranties or representations associated with such dealings, are solely between you and such organizations and/or individuals. You should make whatever investigation you feel necessary or appropriate before proceeding with any online or offline transaction with any of these third parties. You agree that roadmap.sh shall not be responsible or liable for any loss or damage of any sort incurred as the result of any such dealings.</p><p>If there is a dispute between participants on this site, or between users and any third party, you agree that roadmap.sh is under no obligation to become involved. In the event that you have a dispute with one or more other users, you release roadmap.sh, its officers, employees, agents, and successors from claims, demands, and damages of every kind or nature, known or unknown, suspected or unsuspected, disclosed or undisclosed, arising out of or in any way related to such disputes and/or our Services. If you are a California resident, you shall and hereby do waive California Civil Code Section 1542, which says: “A general release does not extend to claims which the creditor does not know or suspect to exist in his or her favor at the time of executing the release, which, if known by him or her must have materially affected his or her settlement with the debtor.”</p><h2 id=will-roadmapsh-ever-change-the-services>Will roadmap.sh ever change the Services?</h2><p>We’re always trying to improve the Services, so they may change over time. We may suspend or discontinue any part of the Services, or we may introduce new features or impose limits on certain features or restrict access to parts or all of the Services. We’ll try to give you notice when we make a material change to the Services that would adversely affect you, but this isn’t always practical. Similarly, we reserve the right to remove any Content from the Services at any time, for any reason (including, but not limited to, if someone alleges you contributed that Content in violation of these Terms), in our sole discretion, and without notice.</p><h2 id=does-roadmapsh-cost-anything>Does roadmap.sh cost anything?</h2><p>The roadmap.sh Services are currently free, but we reserve the right to charge for certain or all Services in the future. We will notify you before any Services you are then using begin carrying a fee, and if you wish to continue using such Services, you must pay all applicable fees for such Services.</p><h2 id=what-if-i-want-to-stop-using-roadmapsh>What if I want to stop using roadmap.sh?</h2><p>You’re free to do that at any time, by contacting us at <a href=mailto:kamranahmed.se@gmail.com>kamranahmed.se@gmail.com</a>; please refer to our Privacy Policy, as well as the licenses above, to understand how we treat information you provide to us after you have stopped using our Services. roadmap.sh is also free to terminate (or suspend access to) your use of the Services or your account, for any reason in our discretion, including your breach of these Terms. roadmap.sh has the sole right to decide whether you are in violation of any of the restrictions set forth in these Terms.</p><p>Account termination may result in destruction of any Content associated with your account, so keep that in mind before you decide to terminate your account.

By way of example, all of the following will survive termination: any obligation you have to pay us or indemnify us, any limitations on our liability, any terms regarding ownership or intellectual property rights, and terms regarding disputes between us.</p><h2 id=what-if-i-use-roadmapsh-via-an-app-available-on-the-apple-app-store>What if I use roadmap.sh via an app available on the Apple App Store?</h2><p>These Terms apply to your use of all the Services, including the iOS applications available via the Apple, Inc.

You may not assign, delegate or transfer these Terms or your rights or obligations hereunder, or your Services account, in any way (by operation of law or otherwise) without roadmap.sh’s prior written consent. We may transfer, assign, or delegate these Terms and our rights and obligations without consent.</p><p>Choice of Law; Arbitration.

The failure of either you or us to exercise, in any way, any right herein shall not be deemed a waiver of any further rights hereunder. If any provision of these Terms is found to be unenforceable or invalid, that provision will be limited or eliminated, to the minimum extent necessary, so that these Terms shall otherwise remain in full force and effect and enforceable.
