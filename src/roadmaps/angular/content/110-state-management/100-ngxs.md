# Ngxs

Ngxs is a state management pattern for the Angular framework. It acts as a single source of truth for our application. Ngxs is very simple and easily implementable. It reduce lots of boilerplate code . It is a replacement for Ngrx. In Ngrx we are creating state, action, reducer, and effects but in Ngxs, we are creating only state and actions instead of all of this. Like Ngrx, Ngxs is also asynchronous and when we dispatch any action we can get a response back.
