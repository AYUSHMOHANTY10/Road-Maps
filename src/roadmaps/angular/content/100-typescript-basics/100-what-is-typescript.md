# What is Typescript

TypeScript is a strongly typed, object-oriented, compiled programming language that builds on JavaScript. It is a superset of the JavaScript language, designed to give you better tooling at any scale. TypeScript calls itself “JavaScript with syntax for types.” In short, it is JavaScript with some additional features. The secret to the success of TypeScript is in the type checking, ensuring that the data flowing through the program is of the correct kind of data.
