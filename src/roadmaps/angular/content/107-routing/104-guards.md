# Route Guards

Angular route guards are interfaces provided by Angular which, when implemented, allow us to control the accessibility of a route based on conditions provided in class implementation of that interface.

Some types of angular guards are `CanActivate`, `CanActivateChild`, `CanLoad`, `CanDeactivate` and `Resolve`.
