# Router outlets

The router-outlet is a directive that's available from the @angular/router package and is used by the router to mark where in a template, a matched component should be inserted.

Thanks to the router outlet, your app will have multiple views/pages and the app template acts like a shell of your application. Any element, you add to the shell will be rendered in each view, only the part marked by the router outlet will be changed between views.
