# Need of design system

Having a solid design system speeds up your work by making the product team more efficient, and it creates consistency and harmony within the product and brand ecosystem.  A strong design system takes the burden off individual designers to think through commonly recurring design problems. With a full library of pre-approved elements, designers can focus on bigger problems like creating seamless, intuitive flows that delight users. That kind of efficiency pays huge dividends over time.
