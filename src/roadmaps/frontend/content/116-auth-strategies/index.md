# Authentication Strategies

Authentication strategies are methods or techniques used to verify the identity of a user or system in order to grant access to a protected resource. There are several different authentication strategies that can be used, including:

- Basic Authentication
- Session Based Authentication
- Token Based Authentication
- JWT Authentication
- OAuth
- SSO

You don't necessarily need to learn all of these, how to implement and the ins and outs from the get go. But it's important to know what they are and how they work. This will help you make better decisions when choosing an authentication strategy for your application.
