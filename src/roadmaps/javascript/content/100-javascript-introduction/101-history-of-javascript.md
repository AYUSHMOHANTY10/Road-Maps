# History of JavaScript

JavaScript was initially created by Brendan Eich of NetScape and was first announced in a press release by Netscape in 1995. It has a bizarre history of naming; initially, it was named Mocha by the creator, which was later renamed LiveScript. In 1996, about a year later after the release, NetScape decided to rename it to JavaScript with hopes of capitalizing on the Java community (although JavaScript did not have any relationship with Java) and released Netscape 2.0 with the official support of JavaScript.
