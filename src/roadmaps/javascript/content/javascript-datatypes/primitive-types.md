# Primitive Types

In JavaScript, a primitive (primitive value, primitive data type) is data that is not an object and has no methods or properties. There are 7 primitive data types:

- `string`
- `number`
- `bigint`
- `boolean`
- `undefined`
- `Symbol`
- `null`

Most of the time, a primitive value is represented directly at the lowest level of the language implementation.
