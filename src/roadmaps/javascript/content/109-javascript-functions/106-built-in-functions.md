# Built in functions

- A JavaScript **method** is a property containing a **function definition** . In other words, when the data stored on an object is a function we call that a method.
- To differentiate between properties and methods, we can think of it this way: **A property is what an object has, while a method is what an object does.**
- Since JavaScript methods are actions that can be performed on objects, we first need to have objects to start with. There are several objects built into JavaScript which we can use.
