# Defining and Calling Functions

**Defining:** 
- JavaScript function *declarations* are made by using the `function` keyword.
- Functions can also be defined by saving function *expressions* to a variable. "Arrow" functions are commonly used in this way.

**Calling:** 
- When a function is defined, it is not yet executed. 
- To call and invoke a function's code, use the function's name followed by parentheses: `functionName()`.
