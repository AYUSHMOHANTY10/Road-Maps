# Data Structures

A Data structure is a format to organize, manage and store data in a way that allows efficient access and modification. JavaScript has primitive (built-in) and non-primitive (not built-in) data structures. Primitive data structures come by default with the programming language and you can implement them out of the box (like arrays and objects). Non-primitive data structures don't come by default and you have to code them up if you want to use them.
