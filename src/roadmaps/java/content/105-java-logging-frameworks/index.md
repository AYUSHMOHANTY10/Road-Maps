# Logging Frameworks

Logging is an important feature that helps developers to trace out the errors. It provides the ability to capture the log file. Logging provides the complete tracing information of the application and also records the critical failure if any occur in an application. There are three components of Logging: Logger, Logging handlers or Appenders and Layouts or logging formatters.
