# Cukes

cukes-rest takes simplicity of Cucumber and provides bindings for HTTP specification. As a sugar on top, cukes-rest adds steps for storing and using request/response content from a file system, variable support in .features, context inflation in all steps and a custom plug-in system to allow users to add additional project specific content.
