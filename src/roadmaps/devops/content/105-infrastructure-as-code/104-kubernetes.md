# Kubernetes

Kubernetes is an [open source](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes) container management platform, and the dominant product in this space.  Using Kubernetes, teams can deploy images across multiple underlying hosts, defining their desired availability, deployment logic, and scaling logic in YAML.  Kubernetes evolved from Borg, an internal Google platform used to provision and allocate compute resources.  (similar to the Autopilot and Aquaman systems of Microsoft Azure)

The popularity of Kubernetes has made it an increasingly important skill for the DevOps Engineer and has triggered the creation of Platform teams across the industry.  These Platform engineering teams often exist with the sole purpose of making Kubernetes approachable and usable for their product development colleagues.
