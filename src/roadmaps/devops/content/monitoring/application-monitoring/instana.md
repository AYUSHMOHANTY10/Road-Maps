# Instana

Instana is particularly used in monitoring and managing the performance of software used in microservice architectures, and permits 3D visualisation of performance through graphs generated using machine learning algorithms, with notifications regarding performance also generated automatically. Instana's Application Performance Monitoring (APM) tool of the same name is especially purposed for monitoring software used in so-called "container orchestration" (a modular method of providing a software service).
