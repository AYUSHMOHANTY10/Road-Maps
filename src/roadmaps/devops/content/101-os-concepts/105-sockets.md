# Sockets

Socket is an endpoint of a two way **communication** link between **two different processes** on the network (same or different machines). The socket mechanism provides a means of inter-process communication (IPC) by establishing named contact points between client and server. It is the combination of IP Address and Port Number.

e.g. `http://192.168.0.1:8080`
