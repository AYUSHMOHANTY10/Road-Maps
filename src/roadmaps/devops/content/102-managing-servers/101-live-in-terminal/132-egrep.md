# egrep

`egrep` (**E**xtended **Grep**) is a pattern searching command which belongs to the family of grep functions. It treats the pattern as an extended **regular expression** and prints out the lines that match the pattern.
It works the same way as `$ grep -E` command

It has the following syntax:

`$  egrep [options] pattern [files]` e.g. `$ egrep "search-regex" *.txt`
