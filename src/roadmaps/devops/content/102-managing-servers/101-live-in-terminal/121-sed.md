# sed

`sed`(**S**tream **Ed**itor) command in UNIX can perform lots of functions on file like searching, finding and replacing, insertion or deletion. By using SED you can edit files even without opening them in editors like [VI Editor](https://www.redhat.com/sysadmin/introduction-vi-editor).

It has the following syntax:

`$ sed [options].. [script] [input-file]` e.g. `$ sed 's/search-regex/replacement-txt/g' file.txt`
