# cat

`cat` (concatenate) command is very frequently used in Linux. It reads data from the file and gives its content as output. It helps us to create, view, and concatenate files.


It has the following syntax:

* View : `$ cat [option] [input-file]`
* Create : `$ cat [content] > [new-file]`
* Append : `$ cat [append_content] >> [existing-file]`

e.g. `$ cat file.txt`
