# Gnosis Chain

Gnosis is a blockchain based on Ethereum, which changed the consensus model to PoS to solve major issues on the Ethereum mainnet. While the platform solves problems surrounding transaction fees and speed, it also means that the Gnosis chain is less decentralized, as it is somewhat reliant on the Ethereum chain.
