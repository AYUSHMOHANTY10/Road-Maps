# reactive

`reactive` allows us to create reactive data structures. Reactive objects are [JavaScript Proxies](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Proxy) and behave just like normal objects. The difference is that Vue is able to track the property access and mutations of a reactive object.
