# Heimdall


Heimdall is an HTTP client that helps your application make a large number of requests, at scale. With Heimdall, you can:

- Use a hystrix-like circuit breaker to control failing requests
- Add synchronous in-memory retries to each request, with the option of setting your own retrier strategy
- Create clients with different timeouts for every request

All HTTP methods are exposed as a fluent interface.
