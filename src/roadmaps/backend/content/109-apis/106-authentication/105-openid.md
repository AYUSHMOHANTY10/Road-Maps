# OpenID

OpenID is a protocol that utilizes the authorization and authentication mechanisms of OAuth 2.0 and is now widely adopted by many identity providers on the Internet.
It solves the problem of needing to share user's personal info between many different web services(e.g. online shops, discussion forums etc.)
