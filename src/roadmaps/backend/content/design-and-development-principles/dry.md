# DRY

Don't Repeat Yourself (DRY) is a software design principle which encourages developers to not repeat software patterns or code. DRY encourages code reusability, often in the form of methods, functions, or subroutines. When DRY is implemented successfully, developers are able to make one change to update many related elements while avoiding making changes to unrelated elements.
