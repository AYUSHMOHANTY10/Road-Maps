# Reactive and Functional programming

Functional programming is a programming paradigm designed to handle pure mathematical functions. This paradigm is totally focused on writing more compounded and pure functions.

Reactive programming describes a design paradigm that relies on asynchronous programming logic to handle real-time updates to otherwise static content. It provides an efficient means -- the use of automated data streams -- to handle data updates to content whenever a user makes an inquiry.
