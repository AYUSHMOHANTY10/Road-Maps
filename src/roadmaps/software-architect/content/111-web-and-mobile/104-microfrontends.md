# Microfrontends

Microfrontends is an architectural style where independently deliverable frontend applications built by different teams using different technologies are composed into a greater whole. Simply, a Micro-Frontend is a portion of a webpage (not the entire page). There is a “Host” or a “Container” page in the Micro-Frontend Architecture page that can host one or more Micro-Frontends.
