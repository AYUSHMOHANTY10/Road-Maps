# Relay

Relay is a JavaScript client used in the browser to fetch GraphQL data. It's a JavaScript framework developed by Facebook for managing and fetching data in React applications. It is built with scalability in mind in order to power complex applications like Facebook. The ultimate goal of GraphQL and Relay is to deliver instant UI-response interactions.
