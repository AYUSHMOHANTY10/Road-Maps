# Knuth Morris Pratt

Knuth morris pratt is a string searching algorithm that uses a precomputed array to find the substring in a string. This array is known as the prefix function. The prefix function is the longest prefix that is also a suffix of a substring. The prefix function is used to skip the characters that are already matched. The algorithm is as follows:

* Compute the prefix function of the substring. 
* Traverse through the string and substring simultaneously. 
* If the characters match, increment the index of both the string and substring. 
* If the characters don't match, increment the index of the string by the value of the prefix function at the index of the substring.
