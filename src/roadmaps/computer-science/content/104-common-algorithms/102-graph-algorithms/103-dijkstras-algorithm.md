# Dijkstra's Algorithm

Dijkstra's algorithm is a graph traversal algorithm that finds the shortest path between two nodes in a graph. It is a weighted graph algorithm, meaning that each edge in the graph has a weight associated with it. The algorithm works by finding the shortest path from the starting node to all other nodes in the graph. It does this by keeping track of the distance from the starting node to each node, and then choosing the node with the shortest distance from the starting node to visit next. It then updates the distance of each node from the starting node, and repeats the process until all nodes have been visited.
