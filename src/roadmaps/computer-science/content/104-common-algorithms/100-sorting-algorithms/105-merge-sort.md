# Merge Sort

Merge sort is a divide and conquer algorithm. It divides the input array into two halves, calls itself for the two halves, and then merges the two sorted halves. The `merge()` function is used for merging two halves. The `merge(arr, l, m, r)` is key process that assumes that `arr[l..m]` and `arr[m+1..r]` are sorted and merges the two sorted sub-arrays into one.
