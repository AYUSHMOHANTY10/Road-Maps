# Common Runtimes

Given below is the list of common algorithmic runtimes. The runtimes are listed in ascending order of their complexity.

* O(1) - Constant
* O(log n) - Logarithmic
* O(n) - Linear
* O(n log n) - Linearithmic
* O(n^2) - Quadratic
* O(n^3) - Cubic
* O(2^n) - Exponential
* O(n!) - Factorial
* O(n^n) - Polynomial
