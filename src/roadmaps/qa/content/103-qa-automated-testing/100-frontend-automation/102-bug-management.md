Exploratory Testing is all about exploring the software by navigating random paths and discovering what it can do and what it canâ€™t. In exploratory testing we try to verify how well system reacts to special/invalid inputs and edge cases. Bug Magnet will help you configure Data validations and variety input scenarios likely to cause issues.
