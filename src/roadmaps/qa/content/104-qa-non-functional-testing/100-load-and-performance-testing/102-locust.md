# Locust

Locust is an easy-to-use, scriptable and scalable performance testing tool. You define the behavior of your users in regular Python code instead of being stuck in a UI or restrictive domain-specific language. This makes Locust infinitely expandable and very developer friendly. Given below are some of the features of Locust.

- Write test scenarios in plain old Python
- Distributed and scalable - supports hundreds of thousands of concurrent users
- Web-based UI
