        <h2 class='text-3xl font-bold mb-2'>What is roadmap.sh?</h2>
        <p class='mb-3'><span class="font-bold ">roadmap.sh</span> contains community-curated roadmaps, study plans, paths, and resources for developers. There are role-based roadmaps, listing skills you should for any given role, as well as skill-based roadmaps listing items to learn for any given skill.</p>
        <p>It started as a set of <a href='https://github.com/kamranahmedse/developer-roadmap' class='font-bold underline' target='_blank'>visual charts on GitHub</a> to guide the developers who are confused about what they should learn next, but then expanded into interactive roadmaps where you can click and get resources to learn any given resource.</p>
      </div>

      <div class='mb-5'>
        <h2 class='text-3xl font-bold mb-2'>Can I trust roadmap.sh?</h2>
        <p class='mb-3'>It's <a href='https://github.com/search?o=desc&q=stars%3A%3E100000&s=stars&type=Repositories' target='_blank' class='font-bold underline'>6th most starred opensource project</a>, visited by hundreds of thousands of developers every month. All the roadmaps are created and reviewed by community and several subject matter experts.</p>
      </div>

      <div class='mb-5'>
        <h2 class='text-3xl font-bold mb-1.5'>What are the plans for roadmap.sh?</h2>
        <p>The website started off as <a href='#'>simple repository containing a few charts</a> for developers and based on my personal opinions but it could have been much more than that so I decided to expand it to a website where people can contribute to study plans with their areas of expertise as well, add more roadmaps, write guides etc.</p>
        <p>We haven't opened up the sign ups for now but we will be doing. My long term plans for this website are to
          turn it into a goto place for the developers to seek guidance about their careers, help others, share their
          journeys, incentivize the learnings, get feedbacks on their projects etc.</p>
      </div>

      <div class='mb-5'>
        <h2 class='text-3xl font-bold mb-1.5'>How did you build roadmap.sh?</h2>
        <p>The basic version of the website has been built with Next.js, is opensource and can be found on GitHub. It
          was hastily done to get it out in front of the people and get people to start contributing, so it might be
          rough on the edges, but that is where we need your help.</p>
      </div>

      <div class='mb-5'>
        <h2 class='text-3xl font-bold mb-1.5'>How does it make money?</h2>
        <p>It doesn't make any money. I have been using my personal time and budget to build it. I did not create this
          website with any intentions of monetization but as a good will, to help the people get out of the frustration
          that I was once in.</p>
        <p>Having said that, I love teaching and my future plans are to be able to work full-time on roadmap.sh for
          which it has to make enough money to pay for my rent, groceries, bills, travel expenses, etc but even if it
          doesn't it's likely that I'll continue growing the site however I can. My focus at the moment is not making
          money from it and just adding content that creates value for the people.</p>
